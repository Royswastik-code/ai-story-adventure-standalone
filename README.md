# AI Story Adventure

An interactive, AI-powered text-based adventure game where users progress through a story by making choices that influence the narrative flow and outcomes.

This project uses large language model (LLM)–based prompt logic to dynamically generate story paths and responses, providing a personalized storytelling experience.

## Features
- Interactive choice-based storytelling
- AI-generated story progression using prompt engineering
- Modular and extensible story logic
- Command-line interface for user interaction
- Configurable prompts and game flow

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Concepts:** Prompt Engineering, NLP fundamentals, LLM-based text generation  
- **Interface:** CLI (Command Line Interface)

## What I Worked On
- Refactored and customized story prompt logic for improved coherence
- Enhanced user input handling and validation
- Modified game flow to support smoother branching decisions
- Improved code readability and structure for maintainability

## How It Works
1. The user is presented with a story scenario.
2. The AI generates narrative options based on the current context.
3. User input determines the next stage of the story.
4. The process repeats until a story conclusion is reached.
